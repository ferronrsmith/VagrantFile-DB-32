VagrantFile-DB2
===============
This vagrant file installs an IBM DB2 express-c 9.7 onto an Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid box.
Install Virtualbox and Vagrant first
* http://virtualbox.org
* http://www.vagrantup.com

## running
Execute vagrant up in the directory with the Vagrantfile and provision.sh - it'll take a while first time.  Subsequent times will take about 30 seconds.
vagrant halt to stop it.
Box is set to be on private network IP 192.168.56.70
Keep the guest additions up to date in Virtualbox by using Vagrant plugin:
	vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

###Examples:
* (Note VirtualBox port forwarding is on so either the private network or localhost will work)
* jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/sample  password: db2inst1
* jdbc:db2://192.168.56.70:50000/sample password: db2inst1
